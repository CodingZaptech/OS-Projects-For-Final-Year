# Process Schedular Simulation

A simple CPU scheduling simulator in C using First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) algorithm. It calculates waiting and turnaround times for processes.

## Features
- Simulates FCFS scheduling for multiple processes.
- Calculates waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- Displays results in a clear tabular format.

## How to Run
1. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Compile the code: gcc ProcessSchedularSimulation.c -o ProcessSchedularSimulation
