# Operating System Projects for Final Year

A curated collection of Operating System projects designed for final year students. Each project is functional and well-documented, making it easier to understand OS concepts through hands-on coding.

## About
This repository provides a starting point for learners and developers who want to explore Operating System with practical implementation.  
The projects are built with clean logic and modular code, allowing you to study, experiment, and extend features as needed.

## Projects Included
- **System Simulations** â†’ Simple Shell, File System, Process Scheduler, Virtual OS Manager  
- **Device Management** â†’ Basic Device Driver implementation  
- **Graphical Interface** â†’ Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) with GTK  
- **Disk Scheduling** â†’ Algorithms like FCFS and SSTF  
- **Security** â†’ Password-based authentication system  
- **Communication** â†’ Chat Application simulation
